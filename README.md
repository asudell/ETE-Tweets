# Analysis of the tweet stream for Philly ETE 2017

My, simple minded for the moment,
attempt to learn something about analyzing twitter streams,
using the tweet stream for
this year's [Philly ETE](http://2017.phillyemergingtech.com/) conference
as an example.
Specifically looking at recent activity on the
[#PhillyETE](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23PhillyETE) hashtag.
